# Macbeth Word Frequency Analysis
This is a Python project that analyzes Shakespeare's play, Macbeth, and determines the most common words used in the play. It also creates a histogram and bar graph to visualize the frequency of the top 25 most common words.

# Installation
To run this project, you will need to have Python 3 installed. Additionally, you will need to install the following libraries:

1.matplotlib
2.seaborn
3.requests
You can install these libraries using pip. For example:

Copy code
pip install matplotlib
# Usage
To run the analysis, simply run the macbeth_word_frequency_analysis.py file. The program will download the text of Macbeth from Project Gutenberg and analyze the most common words used in the play.

The program will print out some basic information about the text, such as the number of characters and the first 500 characters of the text. It will then clean the text by removing punctuation and converting all words to lowercase. After cleaning the text, the program will count the frequency of each word and create a histogram and bar graph of the top 25 most common words.
